# IR-Thermography

## EXPERIMENT: Analysis of left-hand and right-hand thermograms using image processing post cold provocation.
 
OBJECTIVES: <br/>
i. To find the difference in IR camera measurements with respect to the temperature measured by a thermocouple. <br/>
ii. Segment different regions of the hand and find the time taken for the temperature to reach the normal body temperature post cold provocation. <br/>
iii. Understand the skin temperature redistribution after reestablishment of blood perfusion post cold provocation. <br/>
